Simple assembly language example on how to implement ADC in polling mode. The signal from potentiometer is applied to CH32V003 PD4 (AIN7) . PD5 & PD6 are used for UART transmission with approximate 1 second delay between each measurement and transmission. SWSRART bit is used as trigger for measurement and triggered in a loop. The UART uses 9600 BAUD. This program was assembled with bronzebeard light weight assembler and uploaded with WCHELINK.
